# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are best understood through clear, concise, explicit scenarios called user stories. A user story describes an end-user's interaction with a program and what the program's proper behavior looks like.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The approach taken in developing programs will depend on the size of the program. In this class, we discussed working on a large, team-based project using agile methodology. When it comes to working on a team and delivering a marketable product, I think that I will see scrum-agile methods being used. For all collaborative projects, I think that valuing individuals and interactions over tools is a smart approach. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member means to be responsible for your actions and to communicate with your fellow teammates. A good team member will complete the work required of him or her and will be helpful to and supportive of other team members.
